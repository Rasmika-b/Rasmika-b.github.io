                        Greetings, I am Rasmika, and I extend a warm welcome to my semi-formal web portfolio, designed to accompany you on a journey 
                        through the significant milestones of my personal and professional life up to this point. <br><br>Let's get Rolling!<br><ul class="pul">
                        <li> Presently, I am employed at Shell India, a renowned global energy company that is committed to attaining net zero emissionsâ€”a 
                        commitment that resonates deeply with me. I am situated in Bangalore, the paramount technological hub of India.
                        </li><br><li> My foundational education transpired in Gurgaon, located in Northern India, followed by my higher secondary schooling in 
                        Pune, situated in the Western part of the country. For my undergraduate studies, I immersed myself in Vellore, situated in 
                        Southern India. This diverse academic trajectory has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the 
                        Indian culture.</li> <br><li> I like to Code, Debug, Analyze, and build the optimal solutions for various succumbed scenarios. I derive 
                        immense joy from quality time spent with my family and friends. Organizing excursions and embarking on vacations are activities 
                        that I hold dear.</li></ul>

                        <li>While earning my undergraduate degree, I began working at Vriate as a content creator, where I developed curricula and 
                        test questions for a number of Computer Science certification programmes, including those offered by IBM, NPTEL, and NASSCOM.</li><br>
                        <li>In the medical industry, Closer GP, now known as Closer Match GP, is a startup at London. The aim is to quickly and effectively 
                        connect General Practitioners (GPs) with openings. I worked on the data aspect, where I built a database, containing all 
                        the GP-related data.</li><br>

                        In this work, focus is on addressing the situation in a particular COVID-affected region (here, Delhi). The RNN model achieved good 
                        results with an average MSE of 7.2174e-04. To observe the performance of the algorithm, the schedules based on actual and 
                        predicted cases are compared. This whole research work covers different key issues to be taken care of in pandemic situations 
                        i.e. detection and prediction of cases and then scheduling for health care centers and medical staff in a single model that 
                        can easily be made as a web application.
